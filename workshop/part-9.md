This concludes the workshop. Hopefully you have learned enough about how to utilize Tabnine in the development process to accelerate completing the MVP version in time to meet Domino's deadline.

## 📋 Next Steps

It you enjoyed working on this CLI and would like to continue, here are some remaining tasks.

- Review all the prompts and make any UX improvements by changing the [prompt type](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts#-types).
- While your reviewing the prompts, fortify the user input with validation and helpful error messages.
- Add any tests to help reach 💯 test coverage.
- Add JSDoc annotations to all the functions and classes.
- Go beyond the MVP. Explore what the [🍕 Domino's Pizza API](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-dominos-pizza-api/) can do and add more features. Remember to use a fake credit card number otherwise it will order you a pizza.

Most importantly take advantage of your special extended free Tabnine Pro account in your personal and work[^1] projects.
