## ðŸ“Ÿ Here's the Sitch

You have just been hired by Asimov, Inc, a software consulting compoany. A.I. was recently contracted by Domino's to build a CLI to compliment their online ordering system. It seems people are CLIing all the things and Domino's wants to stay ahead of the curve by allowing you to order pizza from your favorite terminal.

The deadline is quickly approaching and the developer who started the project has left the company. You have been given access to the requirements document and existing repo. Your job is to complete the minimum viable product (MVP) version of CLI. It is required that all code be documented and have unit tests with complete code coverage before code can be handed off.

Rumor has it there will be a pizza party upon completion of the project.

## ðŸ“‹ MVP Requirements

- A user should be able to find a nearby store by zipcode
- A user should be able to mark a store as a favorite
- A user should be able to save and update their profile with the following required fields:
  - First and Last name
  - Email and Phone number
  - Address, including: Address, Address Line 2, City, State, and zipcode
- A user should be able to create and place an order containing 1 or more pizzas
- A user should be able to track an order by phone number

## ðŸ’­ Thought Exercise

1. Think about a CLI you use regularly. What did you like about it? What could be improved?
2. Imagine ordering a pizza from within your terminal. What does that look like to you?

**In the next exercise, we'll get you onboarded and familiarize you with the existing application code.**
